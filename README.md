## Problem To Solve

Video game manufacturers, streamers, and viewers all work in a complex environments that trends, ebbs, and flows in a difficult way to track. This visualization will aim to identify some of the prominent factors to help inform these populations' tasks such as video game release dates/updates, streaming schedules, and what to watch. By providing this information visually, we give these users access to data in a way that allows them to more easily pull insights and ask more directed questions, in a way that is much more difficult when looking at the raw numbers in a spreadsheet. The visualization provides the opportunity for more educated timing decisions for companies and content creators, as well as providing a wealth of well documented information on a niche and researched population.
